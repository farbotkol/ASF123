Dear {!oEP.EmployeeName__r.firstname},
<br />

<!--<apex:outputPanel >

<P>
Project excellence is the foundation of AECOM’s success. Outstanding project execution is highly valued and central to our ability to deliver innovative solutions to our clients, to grow our business and to maintain our profitability.  
We know that projects often command aggressive schedules, may take years to deliver, possess elevated client expectations, may have significant financial and operational risk profiles and may require flexibility by staff to work at project locations for extended periods. 
</P>
<P>
To recognize project excellence and the effort it commands, the Deliver to Win Fixed Price Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) is designed to drive continued improvement in project delivery, including financial and operational results, and to reward strong team performance by sharing incremental profits with eligible plan participants.
As a key team member on the 1558-EMC_Env Demo, Remed &amp; Clo project, you have been selected to participate in the Plan. 
About the Plan
</P>
<P>
The Plan provides the ability to recognize and financially reward key project employees for sustained and consistent excellence in project delivery. Plan participants are eligible for cash awards based on the achievement of project targets in profitability, safety, client satisfaction and cash collection.
The incentive or bonus pool is generated by improved gross margin earned on the 1558-EMC_Env Demo, Remed &amp; Clo project. Up to fifty percent of incremental gross margin may be shared with plan participants, with individual awards being based on each participant’s contribution to the project and his/her bonus target. For an incentive pool to be funded, gross margin percent (GM%), the financial performance metric, must exceed the threshold of 2% greater than the baseline GM% (typically “as sold” or current approved budget GM%). 
</P>
<P>
Metrics in safety, client satisfaction and cash collection must also be achieved before eligible participants can be considered for an award. Please see the attached overview of the Plan and DTW Fixed Price Incentive Plan Employee Guide for further information.
</P>
<P>
Current metrics and targets specific to the 1558-EMC_Env Demo, Remed &amp; Clo project are shown in the table below.  Variation orders, modifications, and other changes impacting the project budget may result in an adjustment to the baseline and threshold GM% and/or GM$.

<B>What You Can Earn Through the Plan</B>
<P>
Below are three sample payouts specific to the 1558-EMC_Env Demo, Remed &amp; Clo project.  In each scenario, it is assumed that all operational metrics are achieved and there are no variation orders or other changes impacting the project budget.  Please note, these are examples – your award could be greater or less than the amount indicated depending on final project results, length of time assigned to the project, any annual discretionary bonus awards paid, and your performance and individual contributions to the project’s success.  Incentives are based on results going forward so awards are calculated based on the percentage of the project costs remaining.

To recognize project excellence and the effort it commands, the Deliver to Win Time and Materials Incentive Plan (the “T&amp;M Plan”) is designed to drive continued improvement in project delivery, including financial and operational results, and to reward strong team performance by sharing incremental profits above an established gross margin threshold with eligible plan participants. As a key team leader on the {!oEP.EnrollmentPlan__r.IncentiveProject__r.name} project, you have been selected to participate in the T&amp;M Plan. 
</P>

<B>About the T&amp;M Plan</B>
<P>
The T&amp;M Plan provides the ability to recognize and financially reward Project Managers and key team leaders for sustained excellence in project growth and delivery. Plan participants are eligible to earn awards based on the achievement of targets in margin growth, profitability, safety, client satisfaction and cash collection. 
</P>
<P>
The incentive pool is generated by increasing gross margin through variation orders, modifications, or other changes above a set baseline on the {!oEP.EnrollmentPlan__r.IncentiveProject__r.name} project. Up to {!oEP.EnrollmentPlan__r.IncentivePlan__r.ProfitSharingPercent__c} percent of incremental gross margin may be shared with plan participants, with individual awards based on each participant’s contribution to the project and his/her bonus target. 
</P>
<P>
For an incentive pool to be funded, final {!oEP.EnrollmentPlan__r.IncentivePlan__r.ContractSubType__c}, the financial performance metric, must exceed the baseline, or expected, {!oEP.EnrollmentPlan__r.IncentivePlan__r.ContractSubType__c}.  The project must also maintain or improve the baseline {!oEP.EnrollmentPlan__r.IncentivePlan__r.ContractSubType__c} percent ({!oCH.gmtm}%) and achieve metrics in safety, client satisfaction and cash collection before eligible participants can be considered for an award. Please see the attached overview of the T&amp;M Plan and the <a href="http://my.aecomnet.com/deployedfiles/Intranet/About/Global Project Excellence/Documents/DTW-T&M Employee Guide 4Aug2015 Final.pdf">DTW T&amp;M Incentive Plan Employee Guide</a> for further information.
