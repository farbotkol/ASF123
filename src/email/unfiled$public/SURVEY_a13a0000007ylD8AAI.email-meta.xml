Your Opinion is Important to Us!

Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

We are asking selected clients to provide feedback on our services and deliverables on our recent projects. Your participation in this survey will help us improve our quality of service and provide products that best meet your needs.

Knowing how valuable your time is, we have prepared a survey that will take only a few minutes to complete online.

We recognize that your organization may have its own formal evaluation process. If this is the case, we understand and agree that this AECOM survey will not supplant or supersede your official evaluation. Nonetheless, we respectfully encourage your participation as it will allow us to supplement your ratings with information of specific interest to us and to compare our performance among all our clients using the same data as a base.

Your privacy is important to us; your answers will be combined with others and will not be linked to you personally.

If you have any trouble accessing or completing the survey, please contact Catherine Hader at catherine.hader@aecom.com or 703-682-6108.

Thanks for your help in serving your needs more precisely. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments about the process.
