Science Infrastructure - are we doing enough?
Last week&apos;s Budget presented an ideal opportunity for the Chancellor to maximise the PR for a long-term government commitment to investment in science infrastructure.  The intrinsic link between the UK&apos;s international pedigree in highly accomplished scientific research, and the commercial catalyst to driving the country&apos;s economic  engine is a now well-adopted political mantra. These would have been easy points for the Chancellor in re-outlining the UK&apos;s reputation as the international  destination of choice for research and development. [More]

On Site
Synchrotron sources, including the Diamond Light Source at Harwell Oxford produce beams of light across a large energy range. They are used across a wide scope of  research areas from biological crystallography, to heritage science, environmental science and engineering. The UK has reclaimed its position at the state-of-the-art  in this area with the success of Diamond - the opportunity now exists to move into a real position of international leadership. [More]
