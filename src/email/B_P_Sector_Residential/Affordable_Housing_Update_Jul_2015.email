Our latest article as part of our Housing People programme of thought leadership pieces for 

our Affordable Housing partners (clients), is written by <b>Dr Barbara Marino</b>, AECOM’s 

Head of Health and Safety Consulting. Barbara has some thoughts to offer on CDM 15 and the 

implications it has for clients in the sector.
</p>
<p style="align:left;font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
In April this year a key component of the health and safety legislative scenario, the 

Construction (Design and Management) (CDM) regulations, changed while bringing a substantial 

revision in how duty-holders are responsible, and ultimately accountable, for health and 

safety on projects. One of the main objectives of the new regulations is to create an 

environment where health and safety is paid more attention to the design phase, right where 

the greatest benefits can be achieved and where a cohesive approach can be attained rather 

than an afterthought.
</p><p style="align:left;font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
The revised regulations demand more stringent, and at times absolute, duties from clients. 

This change recognises that the client has a major influence over the way a project is 

procured and managed. Regardless of the size of the project, the client has contractual 

control, appoints designers and contractors, and determines the money, time and other 

resources available. In order to make CDM 15 fully compliant with the European Directive 

92/57 (which CDM is the UK interpretation) domestic clients are now considered duty-holders 

too.
</p><p style="align:left;font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
The change involving the bigger impact on design and consulting organisations has certainly 

been the introduction of the role of principal designer replacing de facto the CDM 

coordinator. However, this hasn’t simply been a re-badging exercise. The principal designer 

is now at the heart of the design risk management, enabling process and in particular the 

principal designer has got the responsibility of planning, managing, monitoring and 

coordinating health and safety in the pre-construction phase of a project. This includes: 

identifying, eliminating or controlling foreseeable risks and ensuring designers carry out 

their duties. Certain transitional arrangements have been set up for projects, which started 

before the 6th April 2015, however by the 6th October 2015 the role of CDM coordinator will 

cease to exist.
</p><p style="align:left;font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
Another significant impact is that clients are now required to appoint a principal designer 

and a principal contractor for all projects, where it is envisaged that there will be more 

than one contractor on site at the same time. This has therefore, broadened the field of 

application to all those projects, which before wouldn’t have been notifiable and therefore, 

wouldn’t have needed a CDM coordinator or a principal contractor. Because of this, clients 

managing project portfolios where activities such as a maintenance or minor works are 

carried out will now need to comply with a wider set of responsibilities than before. This 

also requires assessing the competence of a large number of contractors who will now need to 

act as principal contractors. Construction clients must now review their arrangements and 

strategies to comply with the new regulations with a particular focus on procurement, 

competence assessment and setting up assurance programmes to monitor CDM compliance during 

all stages of a project.
</p><p style="align:left;font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
Therefore, the following points must be looked at and addressed to make sure clients 

organisation procedures align with the new CDM 15 requirements:
</p><ul style="align:left;font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
<li>Scope of work for the role of principal designer</li>
<li>Form of appointments for designers and principal designers</li>
<li>Procurement strategy</li>
<li>Framework agreements (CDMC framework will be no longer valid after 6th October 2015)

</li>
<li>Corporate policies and procedures</li>
<li>Competence assessment arrangements</li>
</ul>
<p style="align:left;font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
Here at AECOM we have been preparing for the new CDM regulations 2015 since the start of the 

consultation process in 2014. The introduction of the role principal designer allows AECOM 

design and health and safety disciplines to demonstrate the full potential of a design 

integrated with buildability, operability and maintainability considerations to deliver to 

clients projects, which are safe to be built and operated throughout their life cycle. We 

have also been proactive in assisting clients and designers with the transition to the new 

regulations in particular in providing CDM advisory activities to principal designers and 

developing clients’ policy and procedures to align with CDM 15’s new requirements.
