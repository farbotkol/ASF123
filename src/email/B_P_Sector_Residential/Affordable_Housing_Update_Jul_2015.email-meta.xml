    <textOnly>CDM 15: A pivotal change for safety in design

July 2015

Our latest article as part of our Housing People programme of thought leadership pieces for  our Affordable Housing partners (clients), is written by Dr Barbara Marino, AECOM’s  Head of Health and Safety Consulting. Barbara has some thoughts to offer on CDM 15 and the  implications it has for clients in the sector.

In April this year a key component of the health and safety legislative scenario, the  Construction (Design and Management) (CDM) regulations, changed while bringing a substantial  revision in how duty-holders are responsible, and ultimately accountable, for health and  safety on projects. One of the main objectives of the new regulations is to create an  environment where health and safety is paid more attention to the design phase, right where  the greatest benefits can be achieved and where a cohesive approach can be attained rather  than an afterthought.

The revised regulations demand more stringent, and at times absolute, duties from clients.  This change recognises that the client has a major influence over the way a project is  procured and managed. Regardless of the size of the project, the client has contractual  control, appoints designers and contractors, and determines the money, time and other  resources available. In order to make CDM 15 fully compliant with the European Directive  92/57 (which CDM is the UK interpretation) domestic clients are now considered duty-holders  too.

The change involving the bigger impact on design and consulting organisations has certainly  been the introduction of the role of principal designer replacing de facto the CDM  coordinator. However, this hasn’t simply been a re-badging exercise. The principal designer  is now at the heart of the design risk management, enabling process and in particular the  principal designer has got the responsibility of planning, managing, monitoring and  coordinating health and safety in the pre-construction phase of a project. This includes:  identifying, eliminating or controlling foreseeable risks and ensuring designers carry out  their duties. Certain transitional arrangements have been set up for projects, which started  before the 6th April 2015, however by the 6th October 2015 the role of CDM coordinator will  cease to exist.

Another significant impact is that clients are now required to appoint a principal designer  and a principal contractor for all projects, where it is envisaged that there will be more  than one contractor on site at the same time. This has therefore, broadened the field of  application to all those projects, which before wouldn’t have been notifiable and therefore,  wouldn’t have needed a CDM coordinator or a principal contractor. Because of this, clients  managing project portfolios where activities such as a maintenance or minor works are  carried out will now need to comply with a wider set of responsibilities than before. This  also requires assessing the competence of a large number of contractors who will now need to  act as principal contractors. Construction clients must now review their arrangements and  strategies to comply with the new regulations with a particular focus on procurement,  competence assessment and setting up assurance programmes to monitor CDM compliance during  all stages of a project.

Therefore, the following points must be looked at and addressed to make sure clients  organisation procedures align with the new CDM 15 requirements:

- Scope of work for the role of principal designer
- Form of appointments for designers and principal designers
- Procurement strategy
- Framework agreements (CDMC framework will be no longer valid after 6th October 2015)
- Corporate policies and procedures
- Competence assessment arrangements

Here at AECOM we have been preparing for the new CDM regulations 2015 since the start of the  consultation process in 2014. The introduction of the role principal designer allows AECOM  design and health and safety disciplines to demonstrate the full potential of a design  integrated with buildability, operability and maintainability considerations to deliver to  clients projects, which are safe to be built and operated throughout their life cycle. We  have also been proactive in assisting clients and designers with the transition to the new  regulations in particular in providing CDM advisory activities to principal designers and  developing clients’ policy and procedures to align with CDM 15’s new requirements.

If you have any questions about the impact of CDM15 on your business or simply want to chat  through how your business manages its implications please email Barbara at Barbara.marino@aecom.com or call her on D +44 (0)20 7061 7143.
