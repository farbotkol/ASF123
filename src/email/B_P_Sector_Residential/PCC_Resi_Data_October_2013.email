The second phase of the Help to Buy scheme, which was first announced in March as part of the 2013 Budget, was due to begin in January 2014. Under the mortgage guarantee scheme the Government will offer guarantees to lenders offering mortgages to buyers who have a deposit between 5% and 20%. It will apply to existing home owners as well as first time buyers. The first part of the scheme, the shared equity loan programme, was launched in April. It makes loans worth up to 20% of the value of a home available to purchasers of new build homes with a value of up to £600,000.</span></p>

They are more commonly seen being transported on ships and at ports around the world. But with the addition of flatscreen TVs, en-suite bathrooms and air conditioning, these shipping containers are now being billed as a solution to London’s housing crisis. The containers come from China and are transformed into studio apartments in Britain which can be stacked on top of each other - and are available to rent for only £75 a week. The scheme looks set to take off after the council granted planning permission to the Forest Young Man's Christian Association (YMCA) to establish two sites in Waltham Forest, north-east London.</span></p>

In the past year, there have been over 460 transactions over £5m and 160 transactions over £10m up 20% and 32% on the preceding 12 months respectively."</p>

                                The London Assembly has called on Boris Johnson to reject government plans which could see shops transformed into homes. The assembly wants the London Mayor to ask the government to abandon plans extending permitted development rights, warning the move would 'drive up rents for businesses, damage the high street, and undermine the principle of localism'. The elected body of the Greater London Authority fears the changes will also 'damage the integrity of some retail areas in London, leaving shops isolated from one another by unsuitable residential properties.'</p>
