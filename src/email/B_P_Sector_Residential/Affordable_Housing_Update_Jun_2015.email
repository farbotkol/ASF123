As part of AECOM’s on-going commitment to affordable housing, we continue our series of thought leadership/service innovation pieces to share with our clients. Please see below our latest article which considers the impact that an ageing population will have on social housing and whether our sector is ready for the challenge that it will bring to us all?
</p>
<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
Like many things in life, ageing well is easier to do when you have resources and can afford to make good choices. From the pot-luck of where and when you were born, to the chances made available to you as you grew up – education, experience and encouragement, to name but a few- many factors shape the road to a hopefully successful and happy life. It seems the same factors apply to ageing.
</p><p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
Social Housing, like the NHS currently, is facing a crossroads. Do we try to cling on to our vocational roots and focus on the social capital that we need to inject into our ageing communities, and hope that advancing technology will assist colleagues in adult social care to meet the exceptionally high demand that we will soon face?  Or do we take a fresh look at the whole picture for the future of housing in general, but more specifically for social housing. Think again, about how we cater for the changing demographic and ensure adequate housing is available for the under 30’s, and flexible housing within a thriving community exists for those who are ageing or vulnerable in some way.
</p><p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
Difficult issues need to be resolved; the shortage of affordable housing, and of decent suitable homes to meet the down-sizers market, the problem of cash poor residents who perhaps bought their property under the Right to Buy scheme, but no longer have the funds to properly maintain it or carry out the required adaptations to continue living in their home comfortably and be able to come and go as they please. Instead, ageing to some means being forced to occupy the parts of their property they can access and rely on carers and commodes to function semi-independently. Even when in suitable accommodation, the abject misery of isolation and loneliness many feel typifies their old age can be just as crippling as failing health.
</p><p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
“Retirement villages” and “neighbourhoods that continue to care” are laudable schemes, but they currently cater to a tiny minority of need. By definition, “retirement” implies a life of work and industry that is now complete – that may be so for the baby boomers and over 55’s today, who may be asset rich with good pension plans. If you look closer at those to follow in their footsteps; in the main it’s a very different story of having had less job security with no final salary pensions, some with very little or woefully inadequate pension provision. That group will be in debt longer with larger mortgages and paying off children’s tuitions fees. They will also be supporting and maintaining adult children, who cannot afford to fly from the family home and may even start their own families under the parental roof. These middle agers will probably have to bear the responsibility of looking after ageing parents, as well as grandchildren – often simultaneously.  The prospect of working into ones 70’s suddenly becomes more appealing to some. Which of us in good conscience could relinquish the family home while it’s in such demand from one or more of our off-spring, especially with the number of families that break up and reform with step-children and extended family members also coming into the household along with the sensitivities that brings? 
</p><p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
So how do stakeholders in our sector respond? How should Registered Providers manage transfer requests and deal with under-occupation to make best use of existing stock, meet general demand and cater for changing needs? With a new Government and Housing Minister recently appointed is this a time for change and influence? Housing, working in isolation, cannot meet the required demands and there needs to be a community wide focus.  We cannot simply move entire communities to “suitable accommodation”, so how do we tackle the practical issues to adapt both the landscape and architecture, as well as the services going in, to suit the changing needs of the existing community? Housing needs to focus on place making with a much wider focus, offering choice to an ageing population.   
The stark reality for us all is that only 6% of the social services total budget spend, is used for prevention all the rest is crisis management.  Housing is then left to pick up the pieces – how to stimulate provision of quality, suitable housing where people want to live, how to establish Effective Partnerships and who foots the bill?
