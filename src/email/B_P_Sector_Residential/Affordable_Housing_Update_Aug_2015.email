As part of AECOM’s on-going commitment to affordable housing, we continue our series of thought leadership / service innovation pieces to share with our partners. Please see below our latest article about a new and innovative solution to housing demand that we believe will be of particular interest to development teams across the sector.</p>
<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
Here at AECOM we are really excited about our involvement in a new solution to London’s housing crisis. Earlier this year the Y-Cube was launched as an innovative and potentially revolutionary new housing model. Named after its prototype, now in use at the 36 unit proof-of-concept Mitcham development by YMCA, the Y-Cube is causing great excitement in the housing world as a potential low cost, quality solution to the affordable homes crisis. Housing providers are already considering its potential for starter homes and as temporary, student or move-on accommodation; however there is equally scope for low cost home ownership since the units will be mortgageable - and as the concept is extended to a 2 and 3 bed offering.
</p><p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
<b>Buildability</b><br />
AECOM’s civil and structural engineering team has been working closely with renowned architect Lord Richard Rogers’ team at Rogers Stirk Harbour & Partners alongside the YMCA in creating the product, which has taken 3 years from concept to realisation. 
</p><p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
Construction costs per unit are circa £30,000, with the timber-framed Y-Cube being manufactured and built entirely off-site. The 26m2 units are self-contained, each with a double bedroom, en-suite bathroom, living room and kitchen and can be stacked to create up to eight storeys. The Mitcham development will feature the addition of communal rooms and external walkways linking the development. Moreover, units are designed to support low-cost living, with tests to date suggesting combined electricity and heating bills at around £7/week.
</p><p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
Foundations and underground services installations, together with site wide landscaping are the only on site activities. Generally for a site with 30-50 modules this work takes a maximum of four weeks on site, with installation of the accommodation and associated prefabricated timber walkways requiring a further two weeks. Following this, provided services connections can be managed to programme and delivery, residents can move in within two months of site start following snagging and final inspections.<br />

</p><p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
<b>Deployability</b><br />
As stated, whilst construction takes place off-site, on-site work involves providing the infrastructure, foundations and services for the Y-Cube unit. Foundations can be concrete strips and pads or small diameter piles where ground conditions dictate. The floor of the module is an integral part so no ground floor slabs are required to be constructed on site. Units are sited directly on the foundations, lifted in by crane. Depending on the working day, ten modules can be sited in a single day shift.
</p><p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
Whilst the modules can be placed in a temporary location - and subsequently relocated - the design life of both the module and its integral elements is 60 years. As such, the product is comparable in life span to other affordable and indeed private sale or market rented properties currently being delivered to market.
</p><p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
Where a provider has a parcel of land sitting redundant, the Y-Cube modules can be sited temporarily until permanent use is determined and then easily moved to a new site. This flexibility of deployment is of great benefit as it allows local authorities to employ the product on a temporary basis, for instance while local infrastructure improvements are carried out, which may increase the value of the said site for other community uses.
</p><p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
Given that a development of up to 50 units can be in place within eight weeks from start on site, it is clear that in the current housing crisis the Y-Cube will be particularly attractive to providers. Rapid deployment, viable across a greater range of sites than traditional build products, should serve only to increase the product’s appeal.
</p><p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
This is a product that has also been featured in the national press, by the Times and the Guardian, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-27381656">covered on BBC news</a> and on CNN having gained the Silver award in the Social Innovation category at the 2015 Eddison awards in New York.
</p><p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
Moreover, the Y-Cube is already attracting significant attention and praise from across government and the housing sector. Brandon Lewis stated last October ‘Y:Cube Housing is a superb project. It presents an innovative, high quality yet low cost housing solution to assist the government in delivering its target of building more affordable housing using off-site manufacturing systems.’
</p><p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
Y-Cube will be the subject of one of the lead sessions on 18-19 November at HOMES event at Olympia, London. We also anticipate hosting a seminar on the product at our Holborn offices in September. Come along and find out more!
