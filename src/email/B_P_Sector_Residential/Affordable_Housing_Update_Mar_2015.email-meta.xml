    <textOnly>Innovating Site Acquisition

March 2015

As part of AECOM’s on-going commitment to affordable housing, we continue our series of thought leadership / service innovation pieces to share with our partners. Please see below our latest article about a new and innovative approach to site finding that we believe will be of particular interest to development teams across the sector.

The balance of economic activities in London is changing. In spatial terms this has resulted in an ongoing restructuring of the scale and type of employment space that is in demand, with a resulting consolidation of industrial land. In 2010 London had around 7,500 hectares of industrial land and policy suggests that around ten percent of this is surplus to requirements. If 75% of this land were to be redeveloped for housing during the plan period at a median density range this could accommodate a minimum of around 100,000 new homes.1

We take a three-stage process to identifying a range of potential development sites across Greater London and the South East suited to the specific needs of housing providers.

Stage 1 Identifying Opportunities

On behalf of our Registered Provider clients AECOM brings together a multi- disciplinary approach to identifying sites, appraising them for acquisition and carrying out preliminary feasibility and capacity appraisals.

Our GIS interactive mapping and database contains detailed information on 9,000 hectares of industrial type land in Greater London and has been developed and updated over a number of years. We believe it is the most complete mapping and information on database of its kind in existence. Extensive site data, taking account of multiple criteria, has been collected and drawn together as a result of months of on-site surveying and desk research.

Stage 2 Acquisition Appraisal

Using our appraisal matrix, we establish the likely capacity, development costs and level of planning risk associated with a site. This enables an assessment tailored to client-specific criteria as to whether the site is a realistic proposal to take forward to bid for purchase or further investment. We undertake a further sifting process and detailed checking to identify potentially suitable sites for housing. A major benefit of our mapping and database is that much of the land is unlikely to be on the open market and therefore not necessarily currently identified for redevelopment opportunities.

Stage 3 Feasibility &amp; Testing

For bids, purchases and preliminary investment appraisals, we create a comprehensive feasibility and capacity analysis. This sets out planning and design issues and options, likely engineering complexities, Rights of Light studies, development cost options and any other relevant issues to give a holistic and comprehensive overview of the development potential of a site.

Within this stage we conduct a demographic evaluation to demonstrate the socio-economic fit between the vision for the project and market fundamentals. This involves a site visit and tour of the surrounding area by the economics team and a desk top demographic assessment with GIS support. The output would be a short summary of the demographic assessment findings with technical data support.

So what do our clients get?

The list of potentially suitable development sites that we have to date delivered for clients’ consideration includes a brief summary write-up on each site incorporating a plan and conclusions on feasibility for each chosen development. Since AECOM also has expertise in employment land research and has developed much of the local and regional employment land policy in London, we can also advise and assist on Development Plan Document representations. We are able to help with change of use where this is an issue as well as being able to offer Employers Agent and associated project and cost management services.
