Second phase of Help to Buy

The Treasury has announced that it will launch its Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme three months earlier than planned. The second phase of the Help to Buy scheme, which was first announced in March as part of the 2013 Budget, was due to begin in January 2014. Under the mortgage guarantee scheme the Government will offer guarantees to lenders offering mortgages to buyers who have a deposit between 5% and 20%. It will apply to existing home owners as well as first time buyers. The first part of the scheme, the shared equity loan programme, was launched in April. It makes loans worth up to 20% of the value of a home available to purchasers of new build homes with a value of up to £600,000.

All aboard your new home

Shipping containers are being rented out for £75 a week to try to solve London&apos;s chronic housing crisis. They are more commonly seen being transported on ships and at ports around the world. But with the addition of flatscreen TVs, en-suite bathrooms and air conditioning, these shipping containers are now being billed as a solution to London’s housing crisis. The containers come from China and are transformed into studio apartments in Britain which can be stacked on top of each other - and are available to rent for only £75 a week. The scheme looks set to take off after the council granted planning permission to the Forest Young Man&apos;s Christian Association (YMCA) to establish two sites in Waltham Forest, north-east London.

Improvements across prime London markets

Prime central London (PCL) house prices continue to show steady year on year growth of 5.6% and quarterly growth of 1.9%, the prime markets of south west London have recorded double digit annual rises and price growth of 4.0% in the third quarter of 2013, report Savills. &quot;These markets are now on average 28.1% above their 2007 peak, just behind PCL at 30.1%. Less accentuated but nonetheless robust price growth has also been seen in other

locations that have historically lagged central London, such as Islington and Wapping. Across all prime London, properties valued in the £1m to £1.5m bracket – somewhat below the 7% stamp duty threshold have performed particularly strongly. By contrast, year on year growth in the £10m+ central London sub-market is just 1.8%; as prices appearing to have broadly plateaued at 38% above their 2007 levels. However, transactions in the super prime markets have remained robust. In the past year, there have been over 460 transactions over £5m and 160 transactions over £10m up 20% and 32% on the preceding 12 months respectively.&quot;

Retail-to-Resi conversions

The London Assembly has called on Boris Johnson to reject government plans which could see shops transformed into homes. The assembly wants the London Mayor to ask the government to abandon plans extending permitted development rights, warning the move would &apos;drive up rents for businesses, damage the high street, and undermine the principle of localism&apos;. The elected body of the Greater London Authority fears the changes will also &apos;damage the integrity of some retail areas in London, leaving shops isolated from one another by unsuitable residential properties.&apos;

SE1 joins &apos;prime&apos;

&quot;In recognition of the elevated profile and higher values being achieved on the evolving south bank, we have extended our definition of prime and created a new area, Central South, in our analysis of the Central London residential development market,&quot; said Jones Lang LaSalle in its latest research document. &quot;Central South will be part of our core area and will encompass the emerging markets around Battersea Power Station and Nine Elms, moving up to include the likes of the Shell Centre, Elizabeth House, Doon Street Tower, One Blackfriars and One Tower Bridge. &quot;It will include developments both on and just set back from the river and will run from Battersea Bridge to just east of Tower Bridge.&quot;

London residential market continues to strengthen

&quot;Confidence in the central London residential market continues to strengthen, with both development and sales activity increasing&quot; report CBRE. This is feeding through to prices, which also continue to rise. The government&apos;s Help to Buy and Funding for Lending schemes are starting to have an impact on the wider housing market because they help to improve both confidence and buying capabilities. This, combined with the general economic recovery, has led to an 11% increase in housing market sales activity over the past quarter across England and Wales.

Property values surge

The average asking price of a home in London is now a record £400,096 and rising. The supply of property entering the market is down 31% over the last year which means that buyers are competing for properties, according to the figures from Home.co.uk. Although house values in London did slip between 2007 and 2011 it now looks as if this period of uncertainty resembles more of a short term blip than a true property crash. Relentless demand to live and invest in the region has driven prices 15.3% higher than when the financial crisis struck five years ago.
