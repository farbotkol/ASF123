                                London's population boom</h3>
                              <p style="text-align: left">
                                <span style="font-size: 9pt;">London’s population jumped by more than 100,000 last year to a new postwar high and at the current rate of increase the capital will grow by the equivalent of an extra borough every three years, hitting a total of nine million people by 2019, according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics. As a result the city needs a more extensive transport network for commuters, says London Mayor Boris Johnson, and 400,000 new homes over the next 10 years. The popular suburbs are where the population is predicted to grow. After past flirtations with locating offices out of town, the mood is now for commerce to cluster in the centre of the capital, though this will inevitably put extra strain on the transport system.</span></p>

                              <p>
                                The tallest residential tower in Europe offering luxury apartments to the hyper-rich is to be built at Canary Wharf. Tom Ryan, the Irish property developer, is planning to spend £1bn on the 74 storey, which will be 7m taller than One Canada Square and only 64m short of The Shard. The Hertsmere Tower will be priced as prime real estate – upwards of £1,000 per square foot in an attempt to attract London’s highest earners to abandon their traditional western haunts of Mayfair and Kensington in favour of the Eastern Docklands.&nbsp;</p>

                                The Evening Standard report that Office buildings in London’s most desirable areas are being converted into homes in the biggest surge in residential property developments since the First World War.</p>
                              Rising property prices have made housing more profitable than office space and developers are moving to cash in on the trend. Commercial buildings in Mayfair, Soho and Fitzrovia, where house prices are booming, are among their targets. The demand has been fuelled partly by super-rich buyers seeking large town houses, according to Peter Wetherell, founder of Mayfair estate agency Wetherell. He said: “We have sold over 100 office buildings in Mayfair back into residential use in the past year.</td>

                                Prestigious Mayfair office 30 Old Burlington Street is to be converted into apartments, while Covent Garden’s 90 Long Acre has been earmarked for a 200-flat development. A portfolio of embassy buildings worth £3billion is also being sold off in Belgravia, Kensington and Holland Park, for residential use. The former Brazilian embassy in Mayfair recently sold for £40million. Mr Wetherell added: “The square footage is worth a lot more for residential. With offices, you’re only selling the floor space and the toilets. A grand staircase isn’t worth anything to someone buying an office but it is a key selling point for a home.”</p>

                              <p>
                                An influential group of MPs, the Free Enterprise Group, have told British Chancellor George Osborne that stamp duty should be scrapped on properties worth under £500k. The FEG argues that the amount paid by first time buyers has increased so much, especially in London, that few now come into the bracket for 0% stamp duty at £125k. It says that increasing the level to £500k would encourage more potential first time buyers to get on the housing ladder. The Policy Exchange also said that 1.5 million new homes should be built by 2020 to come with demand, including the creation of at least one new garden city.</p>

                             <p>Residential property rents across the UK, which have been rising since 2010, are expected to rise by 16% by 2018, according to a report from Knight Frank. It points out that the pace of growth has been more modest since early 2012 but there is room for rental inflation as earnings growth starts to gain momentum across the UK in the coming years. There has been speculation that the support offered under the UK government’s popular Help to Buy scheme could have a major negative effect on the rental market but Knight Frank believe demand for rental properties will stay high.</td>

                                Once again, <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/c1a82b44-5131-11e3-9651-00144feabdc0.html">rising house prices</a> are a topic of conversation at metropolitan dinner parties. Over the past 50 years, figures from the Halifax show Greater London house prices rising relative to those in the rest of the UK by a modest but cumulatively significant 0.5 per cent per year. But people plainly can afford to buy houses in London. House prices can be high and rising if, and only if, people can afford to pay these prices. Some people who used to be able to afford <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/24f4b0b2-57c4-11e3-86d1-00144feabdc0.html">central London house prices</a> are now unable to do so, while others who used not to be able to afford them – or chose not to afford them – can now do so. If prices are rising, it is because the latter group outnumber the former. What has changed is not housing but the backgrounds of the people who live in these homes and their sources of wealth.</p>

                                Britain’s resurgent housing market risks becoming a danger to the economy, Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned in November as he and the Treasury stopped the cheap funding on offer for mortgages. Mortgage rates have plunged since the Funding for Lending scheme was launched in August 2012 on worries that central bank support was not reaching borrowers.“Prices are 7% higher than a year ago” Carney said “Risks to financial stability may grow if there are further substantial and rapid increases in house prices. These risks would be amplified if underwriting standards were to weaken” “The Scheme has contributed to the recovery by helping to improve credit conditions, especially for households,” said Chancellor George Osborne.</p>
