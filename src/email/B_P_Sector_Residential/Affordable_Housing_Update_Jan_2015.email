Mark Everard from AECOM's Affordable Housing Group takes a look at some of the reasons why responsive and planned maintenance contracts tend to fall below expectations and offers some thoughts on how clients can shape their procurement processes to address those issues
<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">
As part of our “Wednesday Club” partnership with Inside housing, AECOM recently hosted a session with Affordable Housing leaders to look at the reasons why so many responsive and planned contracts within the sector fall short of the outputs that are expected of the contract relationships.
A panel including Client, Contractor and Legal representatives spoke openly about where they could all play a part in improving the chances of a contract succeeding 
</p>
<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">
There was fundamental  agreement that the expectations around contracts are often unrealistic. It is only right that the sector should want to deliver a first class service to its customers but it should be realistic about what the sector can afford. Too frequently there is a desire to build in high levels of performance and added value which is at the expense of a practical understanding of what can actually be afforded and achieved. It can also betray a lack of understanding about what is actually needed.
</p>
<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">
Far too often we see a “vicious circle” where the need to re-procure a failing or expiring contract sees the client conduct their planning based on incorrect assumptions, invariably  targeting  cost savings which ignore the economic reality of delivering a good repairs service, particularly within the South East. Consultants then fuel this ambition and drive expectation higher with off the shelf procurement models and stakeholder inclusion processes that ignore the specific needs of their clients. 
</p>
<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">
The downward spiral is then continued by legal advice that can reassure rather than challenge clients and contractors that continue to bid too low through a desire to achieve order book, often at the expense of sensible and realistic contract costing. The “vicious circle” is then completed by clients who fail to act as “strong” clients and the failure on occasions by contractors to deliver the behaviours and culture that they promised in their method statements and interviews.
</p>
<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">
Consultants and regulators then measure and monitor performance using performance indicators that are often inaccurate and occasionally not relevant.
</p>
<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">
This beggared the question that if experienced professionals within our sector can recognise these behaviours then why do they still happen?  Indeed, the sector appears to be in denial on occasions - we all know of contracts where publically the “owners “ of the service talk positively on performance and cost but where, in reality, performance is poor, relationships are fractious and the true cost of the service bears no relation to the tendered price.
</p>
<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">
Our industry group were all in agreement that all stakeholders could do much more to prevent service failures. The reality is that self-interest for stakeholders can interfere with what is genuinely best for a service but equally cost and expense will dictate and sometimes restrict the ability of stakeholders to deliver. 
</p>
<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">
At AECOM we believe that there are ways to mitigate and remove the risks and behaviours that I have outlined. We believe that a smart procurement is driven by a collaborative approach that is bespoke to individual clients It should include the following:
</p>

	<ul style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">
		<li>Considered judgement being given by all parties to building a delivery model appropriate to not just what’s required, but also to what is achievable. Start early - investment at the front end of a procurement process is seldom money wasted. An options appraisal for the service delivery may protract the process but it helps to evidence any Value for Money argument and certainly increases the chances of the procuring the service that it needs.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Clients should listen to consultants but only appoint those who will provide a constructive challenge. AECOM acts as trusted advisor to our clients but also assumes the role of critical friend; we don’t simply tell our clients what they may want to hear.</li>		
		<br />
		<li>Appoint lawyers early but the client must be clear about what they want from the process. The client must not abdicate ownership of and responsibility for the service to its external advisors but equally a poorly drafted OJEU notice can undermine a procurement.</li>
<br />
		<li>There is no one procurement model that suits all contracts. Clients need to invest in the procurement model from conception to inception and recognise that the cost, which may be higher than they would traditionally expend, is nothing by comparison to the opportunity cost of failure.</li>
<br />		
<li>Listen to the contractors in the market when shaping your service. Market Intelligence is important but can be misleading. Soft market testing is important and good contractors will want to engage and help shape a procurement.</li>
		<br />
		<li>Clients must properly commit the resources and time to undertake the procurement. Repairs contracts are crucial for social landlords, so make sure that they are properly project managed and fully resourced. Senior level sponsorship and ownership by the client is key.</li>		
		<br />
		<li>Spend time to define the key project/programme objectives and then capture those in a benefits realisation plan.</li>
		<br />		
		<li>Use a structured Value Management approach in identifying opportunities to maximise value-for-money, without compromising performance or service standards.</li>
<br />		
		<li>Clients must carefully consider the right contract strategy. Instead of simply applying the same "off the shelf" contract terms, we work with clients to create better, project specific contracts which are more suited to the reality of the industry. Recent successes include the use of multi-contractor framework arrangements predicated on a  two stage appointment – selection for Framework Agreement and then Call-Off contracts  This approach can help engineer good performance from contractors (as they are assessed against their competitors), provide early warning of failure if performance deteriorates and, perhaps most importantly, offer real flexibility if things don't go to plan. The ability for clients to access other contractors quickly and on pre-agreed contract terms and prices without having to formally re-procure new contracts helps to provide sustainable service models and keep tenant satisfaction insulated from the risk of major contractor failures.</li>
<br />		
		<li>When evaluating Contractors’ submissions, assess and interview key personnel through their responses to realistic scenarios, whilst maintaining an objective scoring system. In reality the success or failure of responsive repairs contracts often hinges on the calibre of personnel deployed (including those from the client’s organisation).</li>
<br />		
		<li>Adopt an objective and auditable approach to testing the best value (an effective combination of price and quality factors) of contractors’ submissions. This applies particularly where contract pricing includes multiple areas, volume discounts etc</li>
	</ul>

<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">
These are just some of the key factors for our clients to consider if they want to increase their chances of establishing a successful service for their customers.
</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">
Our sector is marked by cycles in the way it chooses to deliver its services.  A difficult economic backdrop has seen some clients see in-sourcing as a solution to the failings of procurement and the private sector. As with working with supply chain partners, there will always be challenges around demonstrating value for money where a client pursues this route. Many of the challenges around delivering a successful service are similar, whichever route a client selects. Likewise, many of the principles of a smart procurement that we outline above are equally transferable.
</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">
The opportunity costs of failing to invest in a smart procurement have blighted our sector for years – AECOM is working with its clients to avoid these costs.
