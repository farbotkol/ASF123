The Department for Energy and Climate Change commissioned AECOM to develop a Metering Viability Tool in order to assist Affordable Housing providers with 

undertaking the tests of cost-effectiveness and technical feasibility.  
</p><p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
The recent Energy Efficiency Directive is another step in the direction of reducing carbon emissions and changing consumer behaviour.  AECOM were able to 

provide the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) with a viability tool to determine whether the criteria of cost effectiveness and technical 

practicality were met and, from a sample of cases reviewed, it is anticipated that at this early stage, with energy prices as they are and the cost of 

meter installation as it is, only a small number of schemes will fall into the category of requiring individual meter installation.  
</p><p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
However, the onus is on landlords, or heat suppliers, to review their stock every four years and analyse data to repeat the feasibility of installing 

individual meters.  A number of cost factors and implications will need to be considered at each review.  It is envisaged that as energy prices remain 

high and the cost and availability of technology improves then more schemes will fall into the requirements of the Directive. 
</p>
<ul style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
<li>30 April 2015 is the compliance deadline – feasibility reports must be submitted to the National Measurement Office by this date</li> 
<li>Compliance and asset management staff should be ready to report on energy performance and carry out regular audits every 4 years</li>
<li>Procurement and recharging for energy processes need to be robust and able to stand up to scrutiny from the independent consumer protection scheme for 

heat network customers, as well as meeting the HCA’s regulatory requirements for transparency</li>
<li>Costs of integration for individual meters or heat cost allocators across asset management portfolio need to be forecast into future budgets</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
With the Government’s launch of an £85m public awareness campaign for Smart Metering  "Get Gaz and Leccy under control"  some residents will be left 

wondering exactly what they do use in terms of energy and how much they could save if they were able to pay for only what they use rather than a 

proportion of a communal tariff.
</p><p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
Depending on how "green" the lens you peer through is, this will represent an opportunity to really address the challenges of outdated, gas-fired mass 

boilers through introducing the concept of combined heat and power, linked district heating systems and other renewable energy options. Critics will argue 

that this is yet another task to add to the asset management portfolio and another cost burden passed down to tenants who may already be experiencing fuel 

poverty.  With the population forecasts predicting more older people living at home for longer with at least one life limiting illness, the requirement 

for temperate homes with plenty of hot water available is only going to increase.
</p><p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
At AECOM we see change, however challenging it may be, as an opportunity to make things better.  Having said that, we don’t believe in creating work for 

the sake of it so have looked to combine good asset management practice with building in compliance for new regulation.  Taking an holistic view across 

regulatory compliance for transparency and service charges, with building regulations, defects management of new technologies in development and efficient 

asset management of existing stock which benefits both landlord and resident we think we have a workable solution for the dichotomy of living with the 

engineering and housing fabric of the past and meeting the new requirements for a sustainable future which is affordable both financially and 

environmentally.
