The AECOM and Carve team was selected as a finalist in the international design competition for an innovative $5 million playground in Denver, Colorado.

Denver Parks and Recreation (DPR) challenged top design teams to re-think the current definition of play as a unique, multi-generational, multi-faceted experience in Denver’s Historic City Park. The goal of the design competition titled Re-imagine Play was to build an iconic playground unlike any before that will promote healthy living in an urban public space.

The Concept
AECOM Denver assembled a team of experts to take on this challenge that included Carve, a creative and innovative design + engineering firm from the Netherlands that specializes in play in public space for all ages. AECOM and Carve’s concept was inspired by a desire to reach up into City Park&apos;s tree canopy and to reach outward to engage the adjacent urban neighborhoods. At the heart of the concept hills and canyons frame three otherworldly interconnected tree structures that reach more than 50 feet skyward. These trees are fully accessible, climbable play structures that provide a multitude of play experiences and exhilarating views. Beneath the trees, roots spread out into four themed play areas that draw their inspiration from the surrounding park and community.

The Health of our Community
The project is partially funded by the Colorado Health Foundation, which supports numerous health-oriented programs around the state. One of the Foundation’s main goals for the Re-imagine Play project is to increase access to active recreation for underserved children and families, regardless of age, race, ethnicity, geography or other limitations. Our team was intrigued by the relationship of health and the built environment and planned our concept carefully to optimize healthy activities for all ages.

The Finalists
The competition began in March with the request for proposals, attracting firms from around the globe. Eight semi-finalists were selected to develop design concepts that were displayed publicly for one month. The public was invited to vote for their favorite entries which guided DPR to choose the three final concepts including AECOM and Carve&apos;s submission, &quot;Root Down &amp; Reach Up!&quot; The three finalists presented their concepts to the public on July 23rd 2012 at the History Colorado Center and the presentations were recorded live.
