    <textOnly>Dear {!Go_No_Go_Conversation__c.Capture_Manager_from_OPP__c} and {!Go_No_Go_Conversation__c.CreatedBy}:

Finance has assigned a B&amp;P number for {!Go_No_Go_Conversation__c.Opportunity_Name__c}: {!Go_No_Go_Conversation__c.B_P_Charge_Number__c}.  You have received this email because you either initiated the Go/No Go conversation or you are the capture (sales) manager for the opportunity ({!Go_No_Go_Conversation__c.Opportunity_Record__c}). If you have a Salesforce license, you may click here to review the GNG record: {!Go_No_Go_Conversation__c.Link}

Please forward this email to anyone else on your team who needs to know the new number. If you have any problems with this charge number, please call or email a member of your Finance B&amp;P Support team: {!Go_No_Go_Conversation__c.Accounting_Support_Team__c}.
