    <textOnly>Dear Colleague:

A client contact has responded to a survey invitation associated with a project that is in your jurisdiction.  The response has been assigned to a {!CFM_Survey_Case__c.Severity_Level__c} - {!CFM_Survey_Case__c.Severity_Type__c} case based on the Client Contact’s response to three questions associated with Likelihood to Recommend, Health &amp; Safety, and Request for Contact. For more about Severity Level definitions, click here.

You are receiving this email because you are the Escalation Owner. The follow-up action case in Salesforce associated with this client survey response was assigned to {!CFM_Survey_Case__c.Follow_Up_Owner_FUO__c}, the Follow-up Action Owner, and is now considered overdue. Our aim is to address and document the action, and close the case, where additional action is not required, within 5 business days of the date the client survey response was received. Please encourage {!CFM_Survey_Case__c.Follow_Up_Owner_FUO__c} to address the follow-up action, document the action taken and close the case. Alternatively, you can get in touch with the client contact in person or via phone and complete the follow-up action on behalf of {!CFM_Survey_Case__c.Follow_Up_Owner_FUO__c}.
