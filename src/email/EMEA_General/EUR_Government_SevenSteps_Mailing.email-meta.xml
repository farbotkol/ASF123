    <subject>Seven steps to being a successful public sector client</subject>
    <textOnly>For those charged with looking  after public property and estate this involves creating and sustaining  affordable practice in procurement, governance and project delivery. In the first of a series of articles exploring how the public sector can  continue delivering at a time of shrinking budgets and intense public  scrutiny, AECOM explains how utilising best practice techniques in the  management of projects are as relevant now as ever.

In Seven steps to being a successful client: a guide for the public sector we  outline the importance of developing a clear vision at the outset of a  project; inspiring the project team; engaging all stakeholders to create an  environment of collaboration; understanding risk; adopting good governance;  establishing clear performance standards; applying lessons learned â€“ both  good and bad; and critically, remaining committed throughout.
