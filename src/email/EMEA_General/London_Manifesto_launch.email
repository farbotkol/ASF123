<b>London’s status as a leading global city is under threat unless there is a fresh, region-wide approach to planning for long-term growth.</b></p>
<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
To confront this challenge, AECOM has published a <a href="http://www.aecom.com/london2065?utm_campaign=londonmanifesto&utm_medium=email&utm_source=list-701a0000002Qhh1&utm_content=text-link&utm_term=london2065website">manifesto for the London City Region</a>, entitled “Big, Bold, Global, Connected – London 2065”, which sets out ideas for the long-term growth of the city and wider south east region, and contributes to the wider debate on housing, economy and infrastructure. The manifesto warns that London’s status as a leading global city is under threat and calls for a collaborative, region-wide approach to tackle major challenges in housing, infrastructure, transport and planning.
</p>

<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
According to the manifesto, without a long-term, integrated approach:
</p>
<ul style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
<li>London risks being overtaken by Dubai and Shanghai in terms of competitiveness within 50 years</li>
<li>A one-million-unit housing shortfall before the mid-2030s could cause social and economic divide lasting generations</li>
<li>Quality of living in London’s communities could suffer as pressure grows on medical services, schools and other civic facilities</li>
<li>Economic growth will be negatively impacted if joined-up, long-term vision and planning aren’t developed.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
The 10-point manifesto calls for:
</p>
<ul style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt; color:#000000">
<li>The definition of London to be broadened to encompass areas of the South East, forming the London City Region</li>
<li>Recognition that the London City Region already has a population of more than 20 million, which will rise to 30 million by 2065</li>
<li>A revised, integrated approach to economic, population and urban growth – otherwise London will not meet the housing, employment and infrastructure challenges of the next 50 years, jeopardising its global position as a mega-city</li>
<li>A new body – a London City Region Board – spanning the public and private sectors to address key challenges in infrastructure, planning, transport and housing</li>
<li>An urgent review of the Metropolitan Green Belt, particularly around tube and rail stations</li>
<li>Politicians, local authorities, developers, infrastructure providers and communities to think at the scale, scope and with unprecedented ambition as they plan for the future.</li>
</ul>
