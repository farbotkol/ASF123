    <textOnly>UK BUDGET 2015: MIND THE GAPS

In &apos;walking tall&apos;, the detail in the Budget reminded us that no one should keep their head in the clouds over productivity, skills and the impact of future government spending.

In a pre-election budget, it is not surprising that there are few new targeted measures to create longer term recovery. An emerging awareness of the longer term risks such as the UK’s productivity gap has the real potential to stifle continued growth.

Key issues in and around this Budget include:

only £295m extra spending to that set out in the Autumn Statement
a presumption that the National Infrastructure Plan remains intact
development of the Northern Powerhouse not only accepted but encouraged
a glaring omission was the lack of reference to the UK’s stagnant productivity levels
the only real housing measure addressed demand, not supply
increased administrative and regulatory burdens will add to the fiscal minefield for UK businesses

The Chancellor said Britain was ‘walking tall again’. We would counsel Britain to mind the gaps – in productivity, skills and spending.
