    <textOnly>Resource-reckoning: eliminating the efficiency gap between building design and use

Buildings are being designed to meet stringent green targets and office occupiers are demanding that their offices are more sustainable than ever before. But are we actually creating energy efficient workplaces that also reflect the wants, needs and cost demands of occupiers?

AECOM and Estates Gazette invite you to the second in their series of discussions looking at the future of offices and their occupiers. In this session, we will examine how we can make the most of all resources, from space to IT and energy, to ensure we are getting the most out of our workplaces.
