With continued borrowing and significant national debt remaining, the Chancellor’s options were inevitably aligned to political motives.  In keeping with the recent 

trend, many of the announcements were made beforehand, with Stamp Duty reform the only real surprise on the day. Osborne made big statements on infrastructure, 

welfare, tax avoidance and the residential market, but little towards new business. With a general election just around the corner, what did we expect?
<br /><br />
Despite no new money, the National Infrastructure Plan provided a welcome message with its transparent pipeline and increasing professionalism as a true programme of 

joined-up aims.  With so much still expected of private financing, investment certainty remains a tricky ask. However, opposition spokespeople’s reluctance to 

guarantee future infrastructure spend does little to build investor confidence.

<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt;">
We would question whether enough is being done to encourage UK businesses to lead on delivering UK infrastructure projects. Therefore skills and training must be key 

items on infrastructure agenda for the next Parliament. 
<br /><br />
For the property and construction industry – just do it must be the key take away.  The message that UK PLC must close the productivity gap was missed and we should 

expect pressure on this topic once the polling booths close next year.
