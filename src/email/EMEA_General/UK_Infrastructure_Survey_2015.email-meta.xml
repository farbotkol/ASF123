CBI-AECOM Infrastructure Survey

A new parliament brings with it new agendas and refreshed perspectives. As the Government settles into office, and political  priorities for the next 5 years are firmed up, it is crucial that the business voice is being heard.

From energy security, to new runways, to delivery of projects such as HS2, this will be a crucial period for infrastructure, and  the CBI will be working to shape policy at every available opportunity.

To be most effective though, we need input from members on what matters most to you - we want to hear about the projects you need  delivered to help your business succeed, and what government can do to best support their delivery.

We would therefore like to invite you to respond to this year&apos;s CBI-AECOM Infrastructure Survey. The results of the survey will  shape the CBI&apos;s dialogue with government, while also making the case for priority improvements to the UK&apos;s energy, transport,  waste, water and digital infrastructure.

Thank you very much for taking the time to support this important piece of work. The closing date for responses is 17th July.

Kind regards,
