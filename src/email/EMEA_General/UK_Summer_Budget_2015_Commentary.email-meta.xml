Summer Budget 2015: Time will tell

Our analysis of the Summer Budget seeks to provide insight and opinion into what Government policy means for our industry, rather than being a simple reiteration of the key measures.

We found that, although this Budget laid claim to being bold and to putting &apos;security&apos; first, closer study suggests it may be remembered more for social engineering, and a step in closing the productivity gap, than for fiscal engineering  and new infrastructure.

Key issues in and around this Budget include:

-competitive tax measures, such as on VAT and corporation tax, intended to reinforce internationally that the UK is leading the way for global business
-a future Roads Fund, but with a significant gap in interim highways funding
-a potential reduction in publically funded housing of 4,000 units per year
-a statement of intent that at least part of the onus of solving and financing the productivity puzzle will be placed firmly on UK business
-a welcome re-prioritisation of Network Rail but no mention of major rail schemes

Despite a big build up, given it is the first truly Conservative Budget in nearly two decades, for our industry too much has been deferred: capital spending, addressing productivity, fiscal reform and planning.  We now look forward to  what has been billed as a &apos;rigorous&apos; Spending Review.
