    <textOnly>Towards the resilient city: A built environment response

How do we ensure that our cities are prepared for an uncertain future?

As a growing proportion of the world’s population moves into cities, a higher proportion of lives and global economic activity is placed at risk from natural  disasters and other threats resulting from climate change.

As part of World Green Building Week, AECOM invites you to an evening seminar chaired by Paul King, CEO of the UK Green Building Council, where we’ll look at  how we can build cities that are more resilient to these threats. You’ll hear from:

Michael Nolan, AECOM’s global practice lead for climate adaptation and resilience, on building resilient cities. Hailing from Australia, Michael has been  working on the UN City Disaster Resilience Scorecard for the United Nations Making Cities Resilient Campaign.

Kate Brown, Grosvenor’s Group Sustainability Director, on building resilience into property investment decisions. Kate will take us through Grosvenor’s  recent Resilient Cities Research Report and explain how the findings are influencing Grosvenor’s strategy.

Dr Andrew Quinn, Senior Lecturer in Atmospheric Science and Engineering, University of Birmingham, will be discussing FUTURENET, a 3.5 year multi-  disciplinary project to develop quantitative methods for the evaluation of resilience to extreme weather events and climate change in the UK transport  network.

Michael Henderson, AECOM&apos;s associate director of sustainability, will be host for the evening. If you have any questions ahead of the event, please don’t  hesitate to ask Mike.
