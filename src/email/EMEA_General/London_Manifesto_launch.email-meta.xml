    <textOnly>AECOM&apos;s MANIFESTO FOR THE LONDON CITY REGION

London’s status as a leading global city is under threat unless there is a fresh, region-wide approach to planning for long-term growth.

To confront this challenge, AECOM has published a manifesto for the London City Region, entitled “Big, Bold, Global, Connected – London 2065”, which sets out ideas for the long-term growth of the city and wider south east region, and contributes to the wider debate on housing, economy and infrastructure. The manifesto warns that London’s status as a leading global city is under threat and calls for a collaborative, region-wide approach to tackle major challenges in housing, infrastructure, transport and planning.

According to the manifesto, without a long-term, integrated approach:

- London risks being overtaken by Dubai and Shanghai in terms of competitiveness within 50 years
- A one-million-unit housing shortfall before the mid-2030s could cause social and economic divide lasting generations
- Quality of living in London’s communities could suffer as pressure grows on medical services, schools and other civic facilities
- Economic growth will be negatively impacted if joined-up, long-term vision and planning aren’t developed.

The 10-point manifesto calls for:

- The definition of London to be broadened to encompass areas of the South East, forming the London City Region
- Recognition that the London City Region already has a population of more than 20 million, which will rise to 30 million by 2065
- A revised, integrated approach to economic, population and urban growth – otherwise London will not meet the housing, employment and infrastructure challenges of the next 50 years, jeopardising its global position as a mega-city
- A new body – a London City Region Board – spanning the public and private sectors to address key challenges in infrastructure, planning, transport and housing
- An urgent review of the Metropolitan Green Belt, particularly around tube and rail stations
- Politicians, local authorities, developers, infrastructure providers and communities to think at the scale, scope and with unprecedented ambition as they plan for the future.
