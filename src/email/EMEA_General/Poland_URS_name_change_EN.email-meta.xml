We are pleased to inform you that on 20 July 2015, URS Polska Sp. z o.o., registered under KRS number 0000035426 with the Register of Entrepreneurs administered by the District Court for the City of Warsaw, XIII Commercial Division of National Court Register (REGON: 630010947, NIP: 7830000292 and VAT UE: PL7830000292), changed its name to AECOM Polska Sp. z o.o.

The KRS, REGON, NIP, VAT UE numbers and the company&apos;s registered address remain unchanged.

In connection with the above, starting from 20 July 2015, the following company details should be used:

The above change is the last stage of process of integration of URS and AECOM groups, which started in October 2014.

The result of integration of both companies is extension of scope of services provided so far and geographical expansion which increases the range of markets we serve. As a leading and fully integrated company, we now have resources allowing for delivery of design and technical solutions for majority of the market sectors.

We also want to assure you that all contracts, bonds and other guarantees will remain in force and will not require realignment. We will continue to work under the existing contracts and serve you as was agreed prior to this change.

We are proud to introduce you to our expanded capabilities, looking forward to furthering our business opportunities together.
