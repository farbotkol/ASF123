ecological surveys
with AECOM

The ecological survey season is nearly upon us, making this the right time to plan your surveys and ensure they are concluded in time to inform the development and planning process.

Many surveys are seasonally constrained to when animals or plants are active and identifiable, and early consideration of ecological survey work can reduce the potential for costly project delays through missing survey seasons.

AECOM ecologists have a wide breadth of skills and experience to ensure we have the right person to manage your ecological issues. Please take time to read our booklet to find out what we bring to clients and who you can contact to arrange your surveys.
