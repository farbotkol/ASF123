Serpentine Pavilion 2015: Private view

We recently sent you an invitation to join us on Thursday 23 July to celebrate the 15th - and our third - Serpentine Pavilion in the beautiful setting of Kensington Gardens.

We don&apos;t appear to have heard from you yet, but do hope you can join us.  The evening will now also feature AECOM&apos;s Virtual Reality team, who will be running a VR booth. Travel through time with our leading-edge virtual environment and immerse yourself in the last three Serpentine Pavilions.
