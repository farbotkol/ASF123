    <subject>INVITATION - The UK Budget 2014 Debate</subject>
    <textOnly>Has the Chancellor’s Budget 2014 delivered what construction needs?

The UK’s construction industry is growing at its fastest pace for nearly seven years, leading to an increasing level of confidence that the industry’s recovery is firmly on track.  With Crossrail getting closer to the finish line; HS2 progressing apace under Sir David Higgins; and the recent floods highlighting the need for new ideas on infrastructure resilience, a potential pipeline of major infrastructure projects is emerging that could help deliver long-term stability to our industry. Who knows, 2015 may even bring long-awaited decisions on expanding our aviation capacity…

However, during this same period, we have seen the construction workforce reduce by 400,000 people and the housing crisis still hangs heavy over the UK economy. So are we really in a position to deliver what the country needs?

In partnership with Construction News, AECOM’s See Further event series continues with a debate about the 2014 Budget and whether the Chancellor is truly delivering a long-term strategy for UK plc.
