    <textOnly>The Next Generation Occupier: Work has left the building

Technology, mobility and four generations in the workplace have fundamentally changed how organisations operate and deliver globally. This makes the office and other places increasingly more important for business success and employee happiness. We are at the tipping point of defining a whole new type of workplace. Is your business ready?

AECOM’s See Further event series continues with a look at what the demands are of the next generation occupier and how to ensure that your business is ready to take advantage.
