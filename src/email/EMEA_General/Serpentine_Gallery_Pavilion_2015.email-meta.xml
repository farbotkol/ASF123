    <textOnly>Serpentine Pavilion 2015: Private view

Join us on Thursday 23 July to celebrate the 15th - and our third - Serpentine Pavilion in the beautiful setting of Kensington Gardens.

Experience bold new architecture that plays with structure, light and form. You could be in for a surprising evening, and at the very least  drinks and canap√©s.

Architecture by SelgasCano
