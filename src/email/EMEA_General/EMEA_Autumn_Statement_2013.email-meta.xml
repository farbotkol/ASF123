    <subject>AECOM&apos;s response to the UK Autumn Statement 2013</subject>
    <textOnly>Things can only get better; but, George, mind the productivity gap

The Chancellor delivered a skilful Autumn Statement with a number of well trailed ideas and, as a result, generated minimal opposition. For UK construction,  sharp eyes would have noticed that the National Infrastructure Plan (NIP) was elevated to the second item on the Government’s agenda.

It was encouraging to see that the focus on investment will continue, and the ongoing emphasis to measure and professionalise the Treasury units charged with  promoting the NIP is welcome. However, this traction must be built upon to help drive Britain’s growth and enable us to compete in the global investment  marketplace for economic infrastructure.

Vital to delivering on these initiatives is having a future workforce that is prepared for the new economic cycles. This makes the decision to create an  extra 20,000 higher apprenticeships, with their emphasis on science, technology and engineering, and 30,000 university student places reassuring.
