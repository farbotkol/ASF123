    <textOnly>LONDON 2065: Big, bold, global, connected
The big issues in planning for growth in London and the South East

London faces a crisis. By 2065, the City Region’s population will reach 30m - putting it on par with the world’s megacities. In the next 20 years, it must accommodate a further 5m people needing an additional 2.5m homes.

Join AECOM and help debate the big decisions that our leaders must make now to ensure London’s future success and how the development industry should be planning for this growth.

Why attend?
The public and private sectors must work together with elected politicians to solve the London City Region’s most challenging planning issues. With speakers from these interested sectors, guests will have the opportunity to join the debate and question our expert panel.

A &quot;Question Time&quot; style debate, chaired by Mark Easton, BBC Home Editor, will follow opening contributions from our guest panellists.

At the event and ahead of the General Election in 2015, AECOM will launch its London Manifesto – London 2065: Big, bold, global, connected.

We are also celebrating AECOM’s new comprehensive planning and masterplanning service offer, following our integration with URS.
