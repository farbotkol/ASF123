    <subject>GNG for {!Go_No_Go_Conversation__c.Opportunity__c} has been approved</subject>
    <textOnly>{!Go_No_Go_Conversation__c.Approver__c} has approved the Go decision for {!Go_No_Go_Conversation__c.Opportunity__c} for {!Go_No_Go_Conversation__c.Account__c}.

If this is a below-threshold pursuit and you did not request a discrete B&amp;P number, the generic B&amp;P number appears on the GNG record: {!Go_No_Go_Conversation__c.Link} and on the opportunity record.

If a discrete B&amp;P number was requested or required, the necessary information has been forwarded to Finance to assign a B&amp;P number.</textOnly>
