<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">
Technology, mobility and four generations in the workplace have fundamentally changed how organisations operate and deliver globally. This makes the office and other places increasingly more important for business success and employee happiness. We are at the tipping point of defining a whole new type of workplace. Is your business ready?
