Heading
Educational facilities have a very specific function â€“ to enhance the way that people teach and learn. At AECOM, we view the design, planning, engineering, and execution of educational and research facilities as means to inspire new generations of educators and learners.
For more than 60 years, we have produced campus master plans of the highest quality, integrating architecture, engineering, program and cost management, land-use planning and assessment, major facility siting, and award-winning landscape and garden design. Our services often include performing a needs analysis to determine if new facilities are warranted, or if rehabilitating and reprogramming existing structures will suffice. We also understand the complexities of multi-stakeholder projects as well as the range of funding and procurement options for educational projects.
AECOM&apos;s portfolio includes the full spectrum of educational facilities, from primary and secondary schools through college campuses and research facilities. Our professionals work in concert with our project partners to produce enduring educational spaces that balance learning opportunity, economic prosperity, and environmental sustainability.
