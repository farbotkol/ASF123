Notes from AECOM&apos;s session at
Designing City Resilience 2015

Dear All,

It&apos;s a few months now since we all spent a few days together at the Designing City Resilience conference at RIBA in London. We&apos;ve produced a set of notes from the conference that we are keen to share. We hope you enjoy and feel free to pass on. Thanks so much for taking part with such gusto and for supporting the approach, and our Mayor!

Please don&apos;t hesitate to get in touch if you would like to offer any feedback on the cities challenge, on these notes, or if you want to talk about the resilience challenges in your own city.

We would be delighted to hear from you. We very much enjoyed the conversations throughout the two days.
