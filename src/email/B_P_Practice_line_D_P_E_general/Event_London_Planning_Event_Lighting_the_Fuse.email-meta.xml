    <textOnly>Lighting the Fuse – how can we build 40,000 homes a year in London?
February 4th, 2014 The Grain Store, Kings Cross.

London Property Forum&apos;s 2014 event, sponsored by AECOM, is a unique morning event that looks at solutions for London&apos;s Residential time bomb. The key note speakers will set the conference themes of planning and infrastructure challenges, modern methods of construction, finance and land and design. This will be followed by an ‘Ideas Lab’ where delegates are encouraged to put forward ideas that they feel would make a difference in 2014. Finally, the London Residential Dragons will decide which pitched ideas should be taken forward and developed.
