    <textOnly>WEBINAR: BEST PRACTICE FOR INCORPORATING SEA LEVEL RISE IN PROJECTS

The seas are rising – this should be an important consideration for anyone located near the shore or tidally-influenced water. During this webinar, we will discuss how to understand the projections of sea level rise for different areas around the country, and different methods for incorporating these projections to develop new high tide and storm surge-induced water levels. We will look at incorporating sea level rise projections into planning projects and design. Finally, we will discuss ways to communicate that the benefits of incorporating sea level rise into projects now outweigh the costs.
