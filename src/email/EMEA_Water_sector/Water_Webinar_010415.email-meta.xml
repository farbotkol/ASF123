    <textOnly>WEBINAR: ADVANCES IN 2D MODELLING FOR FLOOD RISK AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT

Computational power has continued to increase and with the advent of GPU (graphics processor units) optimised software, the ability to utilise 2D models for larger scale and finer resolution modelling has become more feasible.

These changes have resulted in more useful data to assist land use planning and flood risk and emergency management. Standard outputs from 2D models can include not only flood depth and velocity data but also hazard classification information that can assist in evacuation planning, such as time to peak and estimated time of closure for transportation links.

This webinar will provide an overview of the powerful capability across several 2D modelling packages including:

Combined 1D-2D flood and urban system models
Flexible mesh and nested grids
Direct rainfall (rain on grid)
Enhanced GPU processing speeds
Levee and dam failure impact assessments
