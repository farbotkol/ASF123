    <subject>AECOM Webinar: Toward Energy Neutrality</subject>
    <textOnly>WEBINAR: TOWARD ENERGY NEUTRALITY

Water and wastewater treatment works have historically been one of the greatest energy consumers in a community, up to 4% of total power consumed in a city.

In the past 10 years, the emphasis has changed and technologies are now available that will move these major energy users to energy producers. Many plants are already approaching or achieving energy neutrality.

This lecture identifies the areas of treatment and types of technologies that can be employed cost-effectively at your treatment facilities.
