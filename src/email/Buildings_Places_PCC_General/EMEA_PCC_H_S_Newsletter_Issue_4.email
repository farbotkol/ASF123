                                  <span style="font-size:12px;">A demolition company has appeared in court, was fined £5,000 and ordered to pay £12,000 in prosecution costs after part of a stand collapsed onto an excavator driver at the Old Trafford Cricket Ground.</span></p>
                                <p>
                                  <span style="font-size:12px;">The 33-year-old worker from Warrington, suffered serious injuries when a two-tonne concrete slab landed on his vehicle's cab.</span></p>
                                <p>
                                  <span style="font-size:12px;">Warrington-based Excavation and Contracting (UK) Ltd was prosecuted by the (HSE) following an investigation into the incident in April last year.</span></p>
                                <p>
                                  <span style="font-size:12px;">Trafford Magistrates' Court heard the company had been hired to demolish a two-tier stand at the stadium. However, the work had not been planned properly and the excavator type was incorrect and had been positioned too close to the stand which was being demolished.</span></p>
                                <p>
                                  <span style="font-size:12px;">The worker suffered fractures to both legs in several places and severe cuts and bruising when a four-metre wide slab fell from the upper floor onto his vehicle’s cab.</span></p>
                                <p>
                                  <span style="font-size:12px;">The firm pleaded guilty to breaching the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 and the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2007 by failing to ensure the safety of workers and failing to plan and carry out the demolition work safely.</span></p>
                                <p>
                                  <span style="font-size:12px;">A HSE inspector said "The excavator driver was lucky not to have been killed when the two-tonne concrete slab collapsed onto his cab.&nbsp; His life was put in danger because Excavation and Contracting (UK) Ltd didn't plan the work properly.&nbsp; They should have arranged for a high-reach excavator to be used so that the stand could be demolished from a safe distance away. It was only after the incident that this safe method of work was implemented.&nbsp; Demolition work has the potential to be extremely dangerous so it is vital firms plan projects properly and provide appropriate supervision to make sure workers stay safe."</span></p>

                                <p>
                                  &nbsp;</p>
                                <p>
                                  <span style="font-size:12px;">As a result of a routine visits by Kent Fire Safety Officer it was highlighted to a number of Kent Schools that Fire Risk Assessments were inadequate.&nbsp; In partnership with AECOM Building Surveying team who were undertaking a programme of refurbishment works our Fire Safety team were requested to carry out Fire Risk Assessments to rectify the fire officer’s observations. Our assessments however discovered that fire precautions had been overlooked and typical areas of concern were insufficient compartmentation and unsafe fire alarm systems.</span></p>
                                <p>
                                  <span style="font-size:12px;">As an example cavities and voids being created in ceilings, allowing the potential for the unseen spread of fire throughout the whole floor of a building. An effort had been made to compartment the buildings; however walls did not extend to the underside of the floors above.</span></p>
                                <p>
                                  <span style="font-size:12px;">Each school proactively discharged the observations during planned works managed by AECOM Building Surveying team. This approach complimented the programme whereby a Fire Risk Assessment was undertaken before the planned works and thus influenced the schedule of works and prevented the school having further disruption later. These projects highlighted the need for a fire risk assessment to be carried out by a competent person.</span></p>
                                <p>
                                  <span style="font-size:12px;">Having provided the schools with all the appropriate documentation and ongoing assistance, Kent County Fire Officers could see a proactive approach and were complimentary to the way each school reacted to their observations.</span></p>
                                <p>
                                  <span style="font-size:12px;">Based on our experience in Kent, Davis Langdon has been appointed as Fire Safety Advisor on several schools in London and has been successful in providing and setting up sound management systems, training and risk assessments. Schools have commented on how they have benefited from our expertise, not only identifying hazards that they would otherwise be unaware of, but also how we have provided a cost effective service that reacted to the specific needs of each school.&nbsp;</span></p>

                                <span style="font-size:12px;">Extra Care Sheltered Housing provides tenants with a home for life, offering the choice of different levels of care and support as and when required. This accommodation can avoid the need for residents to move onto other forms of supported housing. Residents can live independently whilst enjoying the sense of community and companionship that a range of communal facilities can provide with the added benefit of care provision if required.</span></p>
                              <p>
                                <span style="font-size:12px;">Extra Care Sheltered Housing Schemes provides residents with individual self-contained accommodation, together with a variety of additional communal facilities within one development. Care will be provided to residents on an ‘as needed’ basis, and every encouragement will be given to maintaining independence and lifestyle choice. An important feature of Extra Care Sheltered Housing is the creation of lively balanced communities of older people, ranging from active, independent residents to those requiring a higher degree of care.</span></p>

                                <span style="font-size:12px;">The dwellings were designed to achieve both accredited Passivhaus status and Code for Sustainable Homes Level 4. In order to achieve Passivhaus accreditation, the dwellings were designed to achieve high levels of air tightness, minimal thermal bridging and a system of mechanical ventilation with heat recovery was utilised.</span></p>
                              <p>
                                <span style="font-size:12px;">The selected method of construction was thin joint block work with insulated external render. Triple glazed windows were installed and a gypsum plaster system was used to achieve air tightness. External roller blinds were also used to reduce overheating in the summer months.</span></p>
