NOBODY’S SAFE! ARCHITECTS AND SAFETY MANAGER PROSECUTED

After a routine inspection of a Rugby Club in Wales, a HSE Inspector discovered that contractors had been potentially exposed to dangerous asbestos fibres during construction work at the clubhouse.

The Magistrates Court heard how the architectural practice were also commissioned as the CDM Coordinator but had failed to identify the asbestos insulating board within the Pre Construction Information.

Contractor&apos;s were potentially exposed to asbestos fibres

After further investigation it was discovered that an asbestos survey was commissioned by the Rugby Club and passed on to the architects, but they had failed to pass the information on to the contractors.

The asbestos containing material should have been removed and disposed of by a licensed company but the contractor removed the soffits on the end wall and did not recognise it as asbestos material.

The architectural practice pleaded guilty to breach of Section 3 (1) of The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, were fined £5,400 and ordered to pay £2,917 in costs.

PENSIONERS HIT BY COLLAPSED HOARDING

A contractor has been fined after two pensioners were hit by a hoarding that collapsed in high winds.  The incident occurred at a restaurant at Highcross shopping centre in Leicester which was being refurbished.

Leicester magistrates heard that the firm had put up hoardings which were made out of plywood that had been attached to metal fencing around the restaurant at a height of around 2 metres.

The hoarding was unable to withstand high winds and had been poorly designed.  Part of the hoarding blew over and hit an elderly couple as they walked past, causing them to suffer injuries which required hospital attention.

Contractor Guilty

The Contractor pleaded guilty to safety breaches and was fined £6,000 and ordered to pay costs of £6,735.  It was also ordered to pay a total of £500 compensation to the two victims.

Speaking after the hearing, HSE inspector Mhairi Lockwood said: “The company had a duty to its workforce and members of the public to ensure the hoarding around the restaurant was safe.  It failed to design the hoarding in such a way that it could withstand high winds. Once the plywood was attached to the metal fencing it effectively turned it into a sail.  This couple were lucky not to have been more seriously injured. As it was they suffered injuries and shock that could and should have been avoided.”

CDM UPDATE

Delay to new Regulations

The Health and Safety Executive&apos;s proposed changes to the CDM Regulations were due to be placed before the HSE Board in December 2012 however delays in preparing the draft regulations has resulted in the HSE confirming that they will only be presented to the HSE Board for consideration in May 2013 at the very earliest.

The amendments to the CDM Regulations would not be the fine-tuning the HSE CDM Review indicated last year, The new regulations will likely be a complete overhaul based on a copy-out of the Directive, irrespective of the quality of the existing CDM Regulations.

CDM for Domestic Clients

Headline changes would include the removal of both requirements of Competence and the Approved Code of Practice (ACoP); the design phase duties of the current CDM Co-ordinator being replaced with a new CDM Project Preparation Coordinator and Construction Phase CDM Construction Phase Coordinator. One of the most contentious changes is likely to be the introduction of CDM duties for all projects, commercial or domestic, where more than one contractor is working on a project.

The HSE said they would be concentrating on improving the construction industry’s understanding of the TMCS Directive, the reduction of pre-qualification bureaucracy and replacing the Approved Code of Practice with a series of guidance notes

These proposed changes fly in the face of the HSE’s own CDM Review and the government’s acceptance of the recommendations in Professor Ragnar Löfsted’s Report, published in 2012, both of which suggested the CDM2007 Regulations were working well and only required minor changes in the way they were understood and being implemented

With these potential new duties for domestic projects will the government risk bringing these in before the general election?

DAVIS LANGDON APPOINTED


University of Bedfordshire’s Fire Risk Assessment Provider

Davis Langdon Fire Risk Assessors have won the University of Bedfordshire Fire Risk Assessment Framework. The Framework is for 24 months and will include an overview of the entire estate.

YOUR SAFETY

Display Screen Equipment, Have you been assessed?


The HSE has conducted a survey and found a high number of DSE users with self reported symptoms, e.g. headaches (52%), eye discomfort (58%), and neck pain (47%); other symptoms such as back (37%) and shoulder (39%) pain were also frequently reported. These findings are broadly consistent with other studies published.

The results showed a significant influence of DSE work in that the symptoms were higher among those who spent more time at their computer without breaks. All symptoms were more common among persons who had indications of stress, anxiety and/or depression.

A practical guide for compliance with the regulations and how to setup your work station along with good practice is available on the HSE’s website.
