Being unprepared for extreme weather conditions is not only risky for your teams while they travel, but not having adequate plans can really impact on the way your business delivers its services. A few minutes spent on a plan of action and communicating effectively to your teams will mean your business functions as normal when all around grinds to a halt.</span></p>

                              <p>
                                <span style="font-size:12px;">Towards the end of January 2013, the HSE have issued their first round of invoices under the ‘Fee for Intervention’ &nbsp;(FFI)scheme. &nbsp;£727, 644 &nbsp;was the value of invoices issued to 1418 business who were not meeting the minimum standards expected in a UK workplace and Construction made up for more than a third of the visits.</span></p>
                              <p>
                                <span style="font-size:12px;">70% of the invoices were less than £500 but over 10% were greater than £1000.</span></p>
                              <p>
                                <span style="font-size:12px;">It has been suggested in certain quarters that given over a third of visits involved construction sites it is likely that&nbsp;UK construction projects may face&nbsp;HSE cost recovery&nbsp;in the region of&nbsp;£250,000 during the first two months of FFI.</span></p>
                              <p>
                                <span style="font-size:12px;">Invoices can be challenged, but this must be done within 21 days. The HSE must respond to this challenge and if the receiver is unhappy with the response they can raise a dispute in writing within 21 days of the initial challenge response. HSE will&nbsp;consider all&nbsp;disputes and provide written confirmation of the&nbsp;outcome. If you are not satisfied with this response, you can write again setting out your reasons. A panel of HSE staff and an independent representative will consider your dispute and HSE will write back to you with the outcome.</span></p>
                              <p>
                                <span style="font-size:12px;">The independent members of the disputes panel will be selected on 6 February&nbsp;to agree their terms and conditions so that the first panel can be in place by the end of March.</span></p>
                              <p>
                                <span style="font-size:12px;">You will have to pay for the HSE time spent handling your dispute. The amount to be paid will be the time taken to resolve your dispute multiplied by the FFI hourly rate. If your dispute is upheld, HSE will refund invoices or part invoices you have paid related to your upheld dispute, and you will not be charged a fee for handling the dispute.</span></p>

                                <span style="color:#53a5db;"><span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>NHS Trust&nbsp;fined after&nbsp;failing to&nbsp;follow window safety alert</strong></span></span></p>
                              <p>
                                <span style="font-size:12px;">Medway NHS Foundation Trust has been fined £61,000&nbsp;because a&nbsp;patient died after they fell from a first floor window approximately 5 meters from the ground at Medway Maritime Hospital in Gillingham.</span></p>
                              <p>
                                <span style="font-size:12px;">The Patient suffered serious chest injuries in the incident in 2009 and sadly died that same day. The Patient&nbsp;had previously been admitted suffering with alcohol dependency and was prone to suffering confusion.</span></p>
                              <p>
                                <span style="font-size:12px;">After investigations, the HSE discovered that the window was&nbsp;left wide-open. It&nbsp;was one of many windows on the ward that had no restrictors on them despite Guidance issued&nbsp;in 1989 stating that to prevent falls from windows in hospitals where there are vulnerable patients, the opening &nbsp;should be restricted to a maximum of 10cm.</span></p>
                              <p>
                                <span style="font-size:12px;">The Department of Health issued an alert in 2007 which stated that all NHS properties had to fit window restrictors on all windows by February 2008.&nbsp; Despite receiving the alert and themselves identifying a large number of existing restrictors which were missing or broken, the Trust took no action.</span></p>
                              <p>
                                <span style="font-size:12px;">The Trust was fined £42,000 and ordered to pay £19,073 in costs after pleading guilty to breaching Section 3(1) of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974.</span></p>
                              <p>
                                <span style="font-size:12px;">Speaking after the case, HSE inspector Liz Smith said:</span></p>
                              <p>
                                <span style="font-size:12px;">“The tragic death of Mr Jewitt was entirely preventable. The Trust knew the window in his room required urgent attention, and had a suitable restrictor been fitted in a timely manner then he would never have fallen in the way he did.</span></p>
                              <p>
                                <span style="font-size:12px;">Fitting window restrictors is a simple, inexpensive job that is proven to save lives. It is vital that all hospitals and care homes protect vulnerable people by ensuring windows open no more than 10cm.</span></p>
                              <p>
                                <span style="font-size:12px;">They also need to regularly monitor and maintain existing restrictors to ensure they are working and are in good condition.”</span></p>
                              <p>
                                <span style="font-size:12px;">During the last 10 years at least 30 people have died following falls from unrestricted windows whilst under the care of healthcare establishments.&nbsp; The HSE has issued&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/healthservices/falls-windows.htm">guidance</a>&nbsp;on prevention.</span></p>
                              <p>
                                <span style="font-size:14px;"><strong><span style="color: rgb(83, 165, 219);">Don't be caught out - The Equality Act 2010 is now in place. &nbsp;What does that mean to you as a company or organisation........</span></strong></span></p>
                              <p>
                                <span style="font-size:12px;">As from the 1st October 2010, the Equality Act replaced the majority of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA). However, the Disability Equality Duty in the DDA continues to apply. The Equality Act generally carries forward the majority of the previous protection provided for disabled people by the DDA: 1995.</span></p>
                              <p>
                                <span style="font-size:12px;">With an aging population and the increase in people with disabilities you need to make sure your estate or building portfolio complies with the legal rights of the Equality Act 2010. This in turn can help you avoid highly damaging adverse publicity and legal costs, if action is taken against you. Alternatively, it can promote your company or organisation by opening up access to services and improve your customer numbers.</span></p>
                              <p>
                                <span style="font-size:12px;">In the future, there will be more need for people to live independent lives and avoid escalating care costs. You need to make sure your company or organisation is there ready to make your premises more accessible to people with disabilities, in turn increasing your customer numbers.</span></p>
                              <p>
