    <textOnly>2014 LONDON CONTRACTOR SURVEY:
CHANGING STATE OF THE LONDON MARKET

Our recent survey of leading contractors focusing on the central London construction market, reveals that an abundance of work opportunities means contractors are opting to work for trusted clients and teams, input costs are rising and so are margins.

It’s not just what you know, it’s vitally important who you know in the current market. In this annual survey of contractors in central London, relationships are identified as key in the tendering process at the moment. With plenty of opportunities, contractors have the luxury of choosing between teams they know and trust and those who are new to the scene — or who may have been less collaborative in the past. In the dark recesses of the recession, and even as recently as last year, choice was a luxury few could afford.

The economic backdrop has been one of growing optimism and confidence, with a good stream of work, particularly in the residential sector. There is an anticipated brief slower pace of activity in the lead up to the election, and it’s expected that a Labour victory could produce greater investment in infrastructure.
