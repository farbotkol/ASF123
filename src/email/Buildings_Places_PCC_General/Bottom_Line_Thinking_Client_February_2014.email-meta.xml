    <subject>Bottom Line Thinking - February 2014</subject>
    <textOnly>Welcome to our latest Bottom Line Thinking mailing – the first since our formal name change to AECOM at the end of last year. 2014 looks to be a key year for property owners and occupiers: a rising market, the full impact of the FA2012 fixtures changes, R22 and the Energy Act are key considerations; all against the backdrop of the run-up to the 2015 General Election.

Tax is never far from the domestic or political agenda and our latest mailing includes our take on some of the issues that those involved in the property sector face.  Our bespoke guidelines will help you to be prepared for the obligations imposed by the FA2012 fixtures changes.  We’d be pleased to see you at one of our popular regional seminars next month, further details of which are below.

If there are any particular topics you would like to see addressed in future mailings, we would like to hear from you: Fiscalincentivesteam.europe@aecom.com

Sadly, this is not the case as the following notes will explain.  [More]

R22 Replacement
Businesses that depend on air conditioning, process chilling and industrial refrigeration equipment that contain R22 refrigerant have some important decisions to make to comply with current legislation. It is now illegal (from 1 January 2010) to use ‘virgin’ R22 refrigerant to top up existing installations. This ban will be expanded to recycled R22 from the 1 January 2014. [More]
