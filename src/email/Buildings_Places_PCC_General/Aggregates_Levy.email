The Aggregates Levy was introduced to tax the commercial exploitation of all aggregates. As a result of an EU challenge on State Aid, the UK Budget 2014 announced some changes to the exemptions that were previously in effect for certain types of materials and their use in certain circumstances.

<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">
Following the budget, numerous pieces of guidance released by various organisations informed their members and other interested parties of what to look out for. However, the situation isn’t as bad as has been suggested by the vast majority.
