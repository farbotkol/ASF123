Our recent survey of leading contractors focusing on the central
London construction market, reveals that an abundance of work
opportunities means contractors are opting to work for trusted clients and
teams, input costs are rising and so are margins.
</p>
<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:10pt">
It’s not just what you know, it’s vitally important who you know in
the current market. In this annual survey of contractors in central
London, relationships are identified as key in the tendering process at the
moment. With plenty of opportunities, contractors have the luxury of
choosing between teams they know and trust and those who are new to the
scene — or who may have been less collaborative in the past. In the dark
recesses of the recession, and even as recently as last year, choice was a
luxury few could afford.</p>

The economic backdrop has been one of growing optimism and
confidence, with a good stream of work, particularly in the residential
sector. There is an anticipated brief slower pace of activity in the lead up
to the election, and it’s expected that a Labour victory could produce greater
investment in infrastructure.
