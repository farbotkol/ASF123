Industry News

Controversial plans to charge contractors £124-an-hour for visits by safety inspectors will come into force from October.

The Fee for Intervention scheme will see the Health and Safety Executive recover costs from companies caught breaking the law.

It will start from October 1st with an hourly charge of £124 for HSE inspectors time investigating and taking enforcement action.

Gordon MacDonald, HSE’s programme director, said:

“Confirming the date for the start of Fee For Intervention and publishing the guidance will give dutyholders clarity and certainty about the start of the scheme and what they can expect.

“We have worked with industry representatives in shaping the final form of the scheme and the published guidance explains how the scheme will work and what businesses can do to comply with the law and avoid incurring a fee.

“It is right that those who break the law should pay their fair share of the costs to put things right – and not the public purse. Firms who manage workplace risks properly will not pay.”

HSE’s target list of interventions for 2012/2013 Construction Operational Activities

HSE main operational activities will target the following:

Asbestos (licensing and licensed work)
Small sites/projects
Refurbishment
Major projects/large contractors and clients

The following five generic issues will also be considered during all site visits:

Work at height
Asbestos risks
Provision of welfare facilities
Good order
Respiratory risks.

CDM 2007 Review Latest News

The HSE review of the CDM regulations that aimed to bring the Regulations in line with the Temporary or Mobile Construction Sites EU Directive (TMCDS) was delayed in May 2011 to allow The Cabinet Office ‘Red Tape Challenge (RTC) and the independent review of health &amp; safety legislation by Professor Ragnor Lofstedt findings to be published.

Subsequently, the review found three key areas that required improvement. Firstly demonstrating competence; which many businesses in the construction sector have found to be a bureaucratic and financial burden. This required improvement and be proportionate the level of project risk.

Secondly it was noted that details required by TMCSD had not been embodied in the regulations particularly where it imposes duties on owner occupiers, so called domestic clients. On previous reviews governments have not looked favorably on imposing safety duties on domestic clients as poor media attention would focus on any case where a domestic client had failed to safeguard their site/home.

Finally it was acknowledge that larger, more structured parts of the industry had embodied the requirements of health &amp; safety as part of good business practice, however a ‘two tier’ industry had emerged and smaller companies had not harnessed the Regulations and so low compliance rates were recorded.

The HSE acknowledged that a revised regulatory package should be developed that meets the requirements of the EU Directive, however there will not be a reduction of the high standards achieved by CDM2007 and they should be retained/enhanced.

The Construction Industry Advisory Committee (CONIAC) requested a copy of the new draft to be presented by HSE at their December 2012 meeting and assuming the timetable remains unchanged the HSE plans to consult publicly in early 2013 with a revised package in force April 2014
