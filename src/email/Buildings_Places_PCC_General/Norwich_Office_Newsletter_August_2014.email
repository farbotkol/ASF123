Corporate Games</em></strong></p>
<p class="c4">At AECOM we strive to create an environment where our people can do great work as well as finding time for a bit of fun along the way. With this in mind, a team of seven of us headed down to UEA Sportspark in mid June to take part in the Corporate Games. The day saw us competing in 11 sporting challenges including wheelchair basketball, kayaking and gymnastics and provided a great chance for us to meet people from other local businesses and prove our sporting prowess - we came fifth out of 38! The Corporate Games is part of the Active Norfolk drive to encourage companies to be more active in and out of work.</p>
