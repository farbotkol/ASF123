Introduction

Welcome to our February 2013 newsletter, hopefully by the time you read this the white stuff will have melted away. Being unprepared for extreme weather conditions is not only risky for your teams while they travel, but not having adequate plans can really impact on the way your business delivers its services. A few minutes spent on a plan of action and communicating effectively to your teams will mean your business functions as normal when all around grinds to a halt.

Industry News

HSE inspection charging regime starts to bite in construction sector

Towards the end of January 2013, the HSE have issued their first round of invoices under the ‘Fee for Intervention’  (FFI)scheme.  £727, 644  was the value of invoices issued to 1418 business who were not meeting the minimum standards expected in a UK workplace and Construction made up for more than a third of the visits.

70% of the invoices were less than £500 but over 10% were greater than £1000.

It has been suggested in certain quarters that given over a third of visits involved construction sites it is likely that UK construction projects may face HSE cost recovery in the region of £250,000 during the first two months of FFI.

Invoices can be challenged, but this must be done within 21 days. The HSE must respond to this challenge and if the receiver is unhappy with the response they can raise a dispute in writing within 21 days of the initial challenge response. HSE will consider all disputes and provide written confirmation of the outcome. If you are not satisfied with this response, you can write again setting out your reasons. A panel of HSE staff and an independent representative will consider your dispute and HSE will write back to you with the outcome.

The independent members of the disputes panel will be selected on 6 February to agree their terms and conditions so that the first panel can be in place by the end of March.

You will have to pay for the HSE time spent handling your dispute. The amount to be paid will be the time taken to resolve your dispute multiplied by the FFI hourly rate. If your dispute is upheld, HSE will refund invoices or part invoices you have paid related to your upheld dispute, and you will not be charged a fee for handling the dispute.

NHS Trust fined after failing to follow window safety alert

Medway NHS Foundation Trust has been fined £61,000 because a patient died after they fell from a first floor window approximately 5 meters from the ground at Medway Maritime Hospital in Gillingham.

The Patient suffered serious chest injuries in the incident in 2009 and sadly died that same day. The Patient had previously been admitted suffering with alcohol dependency and was prone to suffering confusion.

After investigations, the HSE discovered that the window was left wide-open. It was one of many windows on the ward that had no restrictors on them despite Guidance issued in 1989 stating that to prevent falls from windows in hospitals where there are vulnerable patients, the opening  should be restricted to a maximum of 10cm.

The Department of Health issued an alert in 2007 which stated that all NHS properties had to fit window restrictors on all windows by February 2008.  Despite receiving the alert and themselves identifying a large number of existing restrictors which were missing or broken, the Trust took no action.

The Trust was fined £42,000 and ordered to pay £19,073 in costs after pleading guilty to breaching Section 3(1) of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974.

Speaking after the case, HSE inspector Liz Smith said:

“The tragic death of Mr Jewitt was entirely preventable. The Trust knew the window in his room required urgent attention, and had a suitable restrictor been fitted in a timely manner then he would never have fallen in the way he did.

Fitting window restrictors is a simple, inexpensive job that is proven to save lives. It is vital that all hospitals and care homes protect vulnerable people by ensuring windows open no more than 10cm.

They also need to regularly monitor and maintain existing restrictors to ensure they are working and are in good condition.”

During the last 10 years at least 30 people have died following falls from unrestricted windows whilst under the care of healthcare establishments.  The HSE has issued guidance on prevention.

Don&apos;t be caught out - The Equality Act 2010 is now in place.  What does that mean to you as a company or organisation........

As from the 1st October 2010, the Equality Act replaced the majority of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA). However, the Disability Equality Duty in the DDA continues to apply. The Equality Act generally carries forward the majority of the previous protection provided for disabled people by the DDA: 1995.

With an aging population and the increase in people with disabilities you need to make sure your estate or building portfolio complies with the legal rights of the Equality Act 2010. This in turn can help you avoid highly damaging adverse publicity and legal costs, if action is taken against you. Alternatively, it can promote your company or organisation by opening up access to services and improve your customer numbers.

In the future, there will be more need for people to live independent lives and avoid escalating care costs. You need to make sure your company or organisation is there ready to make your premises more accessible to people with disabilities, in turn increasing your customer numbers.

Our team at Davis Langdon will only be too happy to help and can carry out a full ‘Access Audit’ or ‘review’ of your existing audit at your premises to ensure you are still complying.  We don’t want you to be caught out with legal action for non-compliance, so get in touch today for some expert help.

“If you haven’t already done so, undertake a detailed ‘Access Audit’ of your building or estate portfolio”

Access Audits are designed to assess your premises or environment to ensure that all provisions for disabled access are in place.  They cover a wide range of physical and non physical barriers and are the most comprehensive method of evaluating your environment.  Davis Langdon ‘Access Auditors’ are construction professionals, and you can rely on achieving realistic and achievable access solutions.  Cost effectiveness is also our target. Our Auditors can also provide you with lots of professional advice regarding legislation compliance.

“Review your existing audit”

We recommend that you Review your existing Access Audit that you had previously undertaken a few years ago, to ensure you continue to operate in compliance with the disabled access legislation.  You need to re-assess your buildings that may have been refurbished, modernised or altered since your last audit.  Changes of use can also be a factor to updating your audit.

Each recommendation our auditors make in our audit reports are given a priority in accordance with bench marking standards set out in the Equality Act 2010, Part M Building Regulations and BS8300:2009. If you need total reassurance that you are operating in compliance with the newly enforced Equality Act 2010, why not get in touch with our team at Davis Langdon who can help you to achieve total reassurance that you are operating in compliance with the newly enforced Equality Act 2010.

Should you wish to discuss further any of the matters raised above please contact our Disability Access consultant John Blackwell on Peterborough 01733 362 000 or email John Blackwell at john.blackwell@davislangdon.com.

Sector Focus - Higher and Further Education
Royal Welsh College of Music &amp; Drama

The Project was a significant expansion to the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama on the edge of a Grade I Historic Park and Garden and has become a ‘Gateway’ building to Cardiff City Centre.

The scheme consisted of the construction of a world class, acoustically excellent 450 seat concert hall, a 160 seat courtyard theatre, the provision of 4 rehearsal studios, theatre design studios, exhibition spaces, and teaching facilities.  The building met BREEAM  ‘Excellent’ rating.

Coventry University, Engineering and Computing Building


New landmark building for the University and its Engineering and Computing Faculty including associated public realm improvements.

This Project involved the construction of a new state of the art teaching and research facility for the Faculty providing in excess of 14,300m2 of replacement mixed use accommodation, incorporating formally disparate items of specialist technical resources for the development of automotive, aero and computing engineering, specifically a 1/6th wind tunnel, engine test cells and three independent lecture theatres collectively designed to enhance the pedagogy of the University.

The project necessitated the demolition of existing buildings on the site, and extensive archaeology, site remediation and replacement of joint use site utility infrastructure in a dense mixed use area of central Coventry.

It presented exciting challenges in coordinating and managing the broad and varied needs of the various Faculty departments, the University and key external stakeholders together with interfacing with other adjacent Masterplan projects. The public realm works included on site highway works, sustainable drainage, utilities infrastructure including diversions, landscaping, and public realm art work.

University of Bedfordshire, Phase 1B Student Centre


The project involved asbestos removal the demolition of a single storey teaching workshop and administrative building.

The construction of a new three storey Student Hub building comprising with a raking main entrance elevation to align with adjacent Business School and LRC buildings and to formalise approach routes around the campus.  The administration accommodation is mainly located on upper levels with the NUS and communal areas at lower levels.  Informal and formal Learning areas are located mainly at first floor incorporating a lecture theatre.  External paving, landscaping and additional parking areas externally.  The building is linked via two bridges to the adjacent LRC spanning a pedestrian thoroughfare.

Challenges

– Inner urban location - security

–  Public footpaths on three sides of the site that were maintained open

– Close proximity of University LRC and Business School buildings that remained fully operational including during remodelling works

– Close proximity of neighbouring properties including church and retail

– Asbestos removal prior to demolition of existing workshop building

– Shared site access road

Added Value

– Assisted in the coordination of phased decanting and reoccupation

– Programmed investigations of existing services (acquired stock)

– Assisting client with temporary changes to Fire Strategy Plan

– Assisted the client in setting health and safety goals for the project

– Provide advice to the Client on the health and safety competence and resources of the proposed designers

– Provide advice to the Client on the health and safety competence and resources of proposed contractors

– CDM workshop to ensure risks are understood by all parties and provided ongoing risk updates at design, site and policy meetings

The Success

Davis Langdon provided CDM services from Stage C of this project together with Phases 2A (on site), 2B (feasibility) and the re-cladding of the Business School (on site).  Working closely with Designers, Principal Contractor and University (Director of Estates, Building Managers and Health &amp; Safety Manager) to ensure safe delivery of the overall project, (no reportable accidents) and meeting the health and safety requirements regarding ongoing cleaning and maintenance activities.

CSCS News

It seems that CSCS continues to go from strength to strength and is now demanded as proof of competence by organisations from across the industry as well as employers, clients and Government
All sites registered under the Considerate Constructors Scheme are required to declare the percentage of workers who hold CSCS cards and to record details of site operatives&apos; and visitors CSCS cards.
The Cabinet Office through the document Common Minimum Standards for the Procurement of Built
Environments in the Public Sector, states that governmental clients are to include a contract clause
requiring that all members of the supply teams who are workers or regular visitors to a construction site
should be able to demonstrate their competence.
The document goes on to say that card schemes such as CSCS can be used to help judge an individual&apos;s
competence.
CSCS have launched a new free app that allows CSCS cards to be read using Android Smartphones using
the latest Near Field Communication (NFC) technology.
NFC technology supports the widely reported use of mobile phones to make low value purchases and
CSCS has utilised this technology to give site managers and supervisors the ability to verify information on
workers&apos; CSCS cards quickly and easily without the need to have access to a computer or dedicated card
reader.
The app is available from Google Play and CSCS plans to make the app available to use on other
smartphone brands containing NFC technology over time.
The new CSCS test which was introduced in April has generally been well received and now includes:

A fully revised and updated question (and answer) bank including the new universal hazard symbols
Questions on &apos;respiratory risks&apos; and the hazards they can pose
A new chapter on the environment with questions on sustainability and environmental hazards
A whole new section of the test designed to measure a candidate&apos;s behavioural responses to three randomly chosen scenarios to highlight safe working practices on site

The total of CSCS cards held by construction workers is now recorded as 1,756,519.
