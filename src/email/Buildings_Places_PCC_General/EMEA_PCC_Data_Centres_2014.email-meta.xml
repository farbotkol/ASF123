    <textOnly>The future for data centres

Data centres are a key part of the infrastructure of modern commerce and public administration. The data centre sector remains highly active owing to growth in cloud computing and more outsourcing by corporates and financial institutions. Although IT load power increases appear to have levelled out at circa 1,000-1,500 w/mÂ², there is an ever-increasing focus on operational efficiency via power usage effectiveness (PUE).

In our paper, Giles Scott and AECOM&apos;s specialist data centre team examine the latest trends in low energy data centre design, rental values, procurement and construction.
